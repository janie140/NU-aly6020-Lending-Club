Introduction

LendingClub, the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform, revolutionizes the financial landscape by connecting borrowers and investors in an innovative online marketplace. The analysis focuses on Q1 2018 data, with the main objectives of building logistic regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict High-Low and High-Medium loan amounts in two responsible variables. We delve into the significance of variables in the logistic model, shedding light on their predictive contributions. Finally, we provide a comparison of accuracy metrics across classification models, including overall accuracy, precision, and recall, guiding our recommendation for LendingClub based on these critical performance indicators.
